Database || Analystics projects 

My idea was to create a database arcitecture that related more to a data dictionary rather than an ordinary schema in the sense that the structure focused on the user and their activity given that the application's nature was for native devices. The below can demonstrate what the DBML used with the https://dbdocs.io and the DBML scripting language is capable of. When used together a mapping of your desired schema is created. Not only does it help you script your actual schema onto your project, but the tools in dbdocs help you make your intended database structure relational. Upon clicking the file above Schema-Vinofy. 

Full Schema coming soon.
